<div id="content"> <p> Picking The Raid 2 over The Raid Redemption (The original) is a bit controversial sure, but I stand by it. People that prefer the first film say that they enjoy the constant incredible action with minimal plot. I can see why they say this and critisize the sequel for its length and conveluted story. Sure. I understand. They will also say the reason all the plot isn't needed is because the reason you watch these films is for the action and fighting. I 100% agree. I enjoyed the first film very very much and it's definitely a close call, but the reason The Raid 2 is on my list is because even though they are broken up with a decent but hard to follow, the action scenes are better. In fact I'd say The Raid 2 has the best fight scene of all time, followed by a number of contenders for the best fight scene of all time. There is also a lot more variety. For example while the first film is set just in an apartment complex, The Raid 2 takes place firstly in a prizon, and then all around a city. There is even an amazing car chase. In my opinion this is the greatest action film of all time and (Welsh) director Gareth Evans is a genius. Here is a list of all the amazing action sequences in the film in the order they happen. </p>
				   <p> <ol type="1">
  <li>The prison bathroom stall fight</li>
  <li>The prison riot</li>
  <li>The '$5000 short' scene</li>
  <li>The nightclub fight</li>
  <li>Hammer Girl and Bat guy VS the world</li>
  <li>Car chase</li>
  <li>Warehouse fight</li>
  <li>Hammer Girl and Bat guy VS Rama</li>
  <li>Kitchen Fight (The best fight scene ever to hit our screens)</li>
</ol>	</p>
<p> I'm being very serious when I say every one of this sequences are fantastic. The Kitchen fight is about 10 minutes long and is a spectacle in choreography and violence. It's a joy to watch.</p>
