 <div id="content"> <p>So to start the countdown off my #10 on the list is Kill Bill. I know, I know, we're off to a bad start. 'Kill Bill isn't a film!' I hear you say, and you are correct, there's Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 but originally they were just one film, and were split because the run time would've been close to 4 hours (and maybe Mirimax saw the $$$ potential). Every time I've watched them it has been back to back, so I'm making the executive decision to have the whole thing occupy #10. The second problem is that after re watching I heavily considered moving it up the list, but my opinions change so much that if I started moving things the list would be a mess and I'd never be able to make up my mind.</p> 
					<p>So let's get into why I'm such a fan. I really like Tarantino films. I love the music, the style, the dialogue, everything that he brings to his films, and this is no exception. As you can see from the notes I made while watching, I think the score is wonderful. I absolutely love the western vibes mixed with the Katana/Samurai action. Some of the score reminded me of the theme from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, which is a classic. The music adds plenty of drama, tension and overall definitely elevates the action</p>
					<p>This is a classic tale of revenge, and it's done to perfection. The action sequences are top notch, all being very unique, and the Crazy 88 fight scene is one of the best of all time in my opinion. That whole sequence is very Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and I love it. The Samurai fight immediately afterwards in the snow with Uma fighting Lucy Liu was stunning visually and a great climax to Volume 1. I also really enjoyed the anime sequence from earlier in Volume 1. It's very unique, absolutely brutal, and a clever way to introduce Lucy Liu's character. The film conveyed a few different tones throughout, sometimes humorous (The brilliant Pai Mei chapter in particular), sometimes intense and serious (The Texas funeral) and the ending was actually quite emotional.</p>
					<p>The performances were great, with Tarantino favourites Uma Therman and Micheal Madson having prominent roles (and there was even a cheeky Samuel L Jackson cameo). David Carradine (RIP) was really  very good as Bill also. I feel as though the first volume is stronger (maybe even as high as #5 on my list on it's own) but the second volume is still great and that it's most fair to judge the film as a whole. Overall I thought it was fantastic (as I do every film on this list) and I hope the world one day will see a volume 3.</p></div>
