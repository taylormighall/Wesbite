<div id="content"> <p>I've recently aquired a newfound love for horror films. Maybe this is because it's only in the last few years I've hit an age where I can enjoy them as films as well as enjoy being scared, but another valid reason is that a certain genre of horror films has been revived recently and they are killing it. Films like It Follows, The Babadook, Don't Breathe and of course, The Witch, have been scary because of the atmosphere and plot, not because of Jump scares.</p>
				   <p>An abundance of lazy jump scares actively ruin horror films for me. I recently watched The Haunting in Conneticut and throughout the whole first half it would almost randomly cut to loud scare chords and gory imagery. For no reason. In The Witch the biggest jump scare begins with a long, quiet, earie shot looking into the woods, then you quietly hear "Peeka" and then "Boo" as it cuts to the face of the family baby. The horror from The Witch comes entirely from the atmosphere. Some people complained that it just wasn't scary, but from the start all the way to the end I had an intense feeling of dread. Butterflies in my stomach. I am a huge fan of this approach. Robert Eggers put on a masterclass here.</p>
				   <p> The basic premise is as follows. It's 17th centuary New England and a Puritan family consisting of the Dad William, his wife Katherine, son Caleb, daughter Thomasin, and 2 younger twins are made to leave the nearby Puritan town and settle at a farm quite a distance away by the deep woods. Rumour has it these woods house witches, and conflict of the film is whether the things happening to the family are supernatural, and if so is one of them (namely Thomasin) a witch already. It's the simple story of a family falling apart. I won't spoil anything but the payoff is absolutely amazing. Black Phillip is iconic. Another stand out scene apart from the end is the exorcism. Fantastic stuff.</p>
				   <p> Another critisicm people have is about the dialogue and not understanding what is going on. This is fairly reasonable because the film tries to be as authentic as possible with its 1600s old english. There are a lot of thou's and the family have a thick northern accent which can be difficult for Americans to understand. Us brits are used to it however so it's really not that bad. It certainly doesn't detract from the film, in fact the authenticity makes it even more chilling. Overall I really loved this film, the suspence killed me the whole time and the payoff made it all worth it, and that's exactly what I want from a horror film.</p>
