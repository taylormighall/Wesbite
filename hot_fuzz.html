<div id="content"> <p> There are a few directors that just do it for me. Quentin Tarentino, Christopher Nolan (We'll get there) and of course, the director of Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright. I really love all of his films and I've got high hopes for Baby Driver which is coming out soon. For my favourite and which should take this spot on the list it's really a toss up between what made it in the end, Hot Fuzz, or the first film in the Cornetto Trilogy, Shaun of the Dead. This changes all the time in my head, mostly depending on which one I've seen last, but I think for now we'll stick with Hot Fuzz. The issue is that I like both films for very similar reasons. Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Edgar Wright. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are always hilarious and have amazing chemistry and Edgar's direction is fantastic. The quick cuts, heavy style, rapid fire jokes and just how clever the writing is.</p>
				   <p> And Hot Fuzz is a hilarious film with constant jokes. Every time I watch it (and I've seen it quite a few times) I catch a load of new jokes and lines I hadn't before noticed (reading the wikipedia page I've just realised that 'The Greater Good' group is the Neighborhood Watch Alliance, or NWA). I think what really sets apart Hot Fuzz is that aside from being hilarious, the mystery of the plot is great, and the action is actually really good. The last 3rd of the film is one big over the top action scene and it's done really well. I especially like the battle in Sommerfield supermarket.	The film is actually quite violent, with one death at the end very gory, but I guess another death at the end of Shaun of the Dead was also very graphic so this isn't that much of a surprise.</p>
				   <p> One thing I've noticed about the Edgar Wright films is that everything is very deliberate. For example characters names are often for a reason, and events happen as they do very specifically. In an early scene of Simon Pegg's character jogging in his first morning in Sanford, all of the NWA members can be seen standing in the same positions they later stand in for the 'final showdown'. Also every annoying question Frost's character asks Pegg, that Pegg replies are silly, are things that Pegg does in the last action sequence.</p>
