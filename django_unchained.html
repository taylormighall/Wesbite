<div id="content"><p> So here it is, #1 on my list, my current favourite film of all time, Django Unchained. If there are a few things I look for in a good film, it's good action (check), witty dialogue (the Tarantino special), cool music (as you can hear if your volume is on), hats (there are many hats), a long run time, and also a few scenes set in the snow? Django does all of these things and more. From the first shot to the last I love it. The 4 main characters, played by Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz (who won the Oscar for best supporting actor), Leonado Dicaprio, and Samuel L Jackson, were all fantastic in their roles. Originally the titular Django was going to be played by Will Smith but he refused because "Django wasn't the lead" and didn't get to kill Calvin Candie (which is a little bit very silly, because Django is certainly the lead, and he gets to kill the even bigger bad). I think Foxx was better than Smith would've been anyway. Another amazing cameo in the film was Jonah Hill as a KKK member in an absoutely hilarious scene consisting of KKK memebers arguing over homemade hoods not fitting properly. The film just goes from breathtaking sequence to breathtaking sequence and never really lets up, all with the Tarantino style coursing through its veins. Just go and watch it yourself, even my mum, who was not keen about some of the films on the list, really thinks Django Unchained is brilliant.</p>
				  <p> To wrap this all up, below is a video of my 15 year old brother power reviewing all of the films on the list for our amusement.</p>
