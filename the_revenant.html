<div id="content"><p> The Revenant is a funny one, it's a film that everyone can agree is a masterpiece but whether you actually enjoy it heavily comes down to personal preference. I obviously am in the camp of loving it. You can't argue that the acting isn't outstanding (Leo finally won the Oscar and still many people, myself included, think that Tom Hardy's performance was even better), or that the cinematography isn't beautiful, or that the fight scenes aren't extremely well done. However quite a number of people don't like the length and pacing, and I understand these gripes. The film is 2 hours and 40 minutes and the middle mainly consists of Leo walking through the woods, or walking through the snow, or walking along a river, and many find this slow and boring. Personally I thought that the cinematography was so good that it made all of these scenes great to watch. There are so many wide angle, beautifully lit shots that are just magical to watch, especially at a cinema in 4k. Between this, Mad Max and the next film on my list you can tell I really do love me some cinematography.</p>

<p>The survival aspects are brutal and gritty and well played out. The scene where Leo closes a hole in his throat by putting gunpowder in it and lighting it to cauterise the wound is hard to watch. I also liked him sleeping inside the horse. The action sequences were nicely shot against the snow and were lovely and violent, the first and last scenes especially. The Indians were actually scary, and the scalping one character gets in particular is shocking. One complaint I do have is that the dream sequences that occur a few times are a bit strange and long. I'm still not super sure what was going on with those and they made the film a bit longer than it could've been.</p>

<p>A scene which I haven't talked about yet is the much revered Bear scene. The Bear Scene is iconic and it will go down in film history. It is absolutely thrilling, incredibly brutal and overall an absolute masterpiece. The CGI with the Bear is absolutely fantastic also.</p>

<p>One final point is that the poster for The Revenant is fantastic <a href="http://www.impawards.com/2015/revenant_xlg.html">(The "n. One who has returned, as if from the dead" poster)</a></p>
