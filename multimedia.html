<div id="content"><p> Multimedia is a vital part of the internet and web design. Virtually everything you see on your computer and on the internet is multimedia (content that uses multiple forms of media such as images, audio, video, animations and text). It can also be interactive. The internet wasn't always this way however. Back when it first began and for many years afterwards websites were just hypertext as anything else was too large. Finally though in 1992 the first ever picture was posted. It was of a pop parody girl band called Les Horribles Cernettes who were based at CERN and was uploaded by the inventor of the internet Sir Tim Berners-Lee. From then onwards images quickly became a key feature of websites and the internet as a whole. </p>
<p>I cannot find when the first use of audio on the internet happened, but the first internet radio show was "Internet Talk Radio" launched in 1993. Later that year the first internet concert was broadcast by the band Severe Tire Damage which was also the first video put directly online. Before this things could be downloaded and played afterwards but this is the first streamed video. Over the years as bandwidth has gotten higher and higher videos and audio can now be streamed in extremely high quality, and very high resolution pictures can be displayed. </p>
<p>As I said before, the use of multimedia is now universal, but why is it so popular? I believe it is because multimedia is a much more engaging way of communicating information than just text alone. It keeps the audience entertained by using  a variety of different media to keep them stimulated and interesting in what they're learning. There's a learning theory that says ""we remember 30% of what we see, 20% of what we hear, 10% of what we read and 40% of what we do.".  All of these things can be met using multimedia. You may notice that the largest number at 40% is actually doing things and think that multimedia doesn't cover that but you'd be incorrect. Multimedia includes interactivity. An example of this is on <a href=https://www.khanacademy.org/> Khan Academy </a> where users can learn by watch and listening to a video, but then can also take interactive tests.  This helps users understand concepts more easily as it appeals to all sorts of learning types.</p>
<p>Multimedia is also used heavily for advertising. Clickable banners as adverts are prevalent because the pictures get the users attention and can convey more information than just words can. A lot of the time pop up adverts play sound and video automatically to try to get something across before they inevitably get closed down by the user. Video ads before things like YouTube videos are also effective in getting the users attention if the first 5 seconds of video are enticing. </p>
<p>Overall multimedia is used all over the internet for a variety of reasons. From its humble beginnings to now the technology is only improving and making the internet a more exciting place for us all. </p>
