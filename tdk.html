<div id="content">	<p>I will happily say I like superhero movies, in fact I like them a lot. I eagerly anticipate every Marvel release, every Fox film (in fact if I had seen Logan before I decided on my list for this website then things could have been interesting), and I even quite enjoyed Man of Steel and BvS from our friends at DC (We don't talk about Suicide Squad). Despite this there are fairly few superhero films I've really loved and none that have even come close to the extent I love this film. The Dark Knight was my favourite film for a long, long time. It took a whole lot for it to be unseated, and I am pretty certain it was be my favourite superhero film for many years to come, and all this coming from a film that was released before the Superhero Boom even started. 
					<p>Most of the other films I did a re-watch of to compile my thoughts so I could write about it, but for TDK it was unnecessary. I have seen this film maybe more times than any other film since I was a small child watching Disney films endlessly and I know it inside and out. The opening bank heist that culminates with the reveal of The Joker is probably my favourite opening scene of all time. This scene, and the whole film, is masterfully crafted by Nolan. I could rattle off a list of other scenes I really enjoyed but then you would just be reading a synopsis of the film. 
					<p>I think a key reason that the Nolan Batman Trilogy, and this film in particular, are thought as so highly compared to the other superhero films is that the character work is very well done, and the villains are extremely strong. In fact the villains are  in my opinion the best parts in all 3 of the films. Heath Ledgers Oscar winning performance as The Joker is absolutely iconic and maybe one of the best performances in any film ever. He stole every scene he was in, and really elevated the film for me. Saying that though maybe doesn't give the rest of the film enough credit, because the acting is great all round. Christian Bale gave us the classic 'WHERE IS SHE?', Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, Gary Oldman is great as usual, and Aaron Eckhart does an outstanding job as the other protagonist/eventual antagonist Harvey Dent. 
					<p>I could talk about how much I enjoyed almost every aspect of the movie all day, so instead let's talk about how The Joker was really the hero of the story. He waltzes in to the crime riddled mess that is Gotham and single handedly, in just a few weeks, eliminates almost all Organised Crime, reveals multiple corrupt policemen, gives Detective Gordon the means to become Commissioner, and retires Batman for 9 years. That last point may seem like a negative, but really all Batman is is a millionaire beating up mentally disabled poor people to cope with the death of his parents. And in the process all The Joker really does wrong is lobotomise that guy with a pencil and blow up a hospital (and a police station, and Rachael, and okay he kills a few more people, maybe he is a monster after all).
