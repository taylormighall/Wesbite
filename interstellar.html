<div id="content"><p> Interstellar is another film people are very divided on, except this time I don't really see why. They think it's too long maybe? They interperet the 'Power of Love' explaination as how the sci fi stuff happens instead of why? I'm really not sure. What I am very sure about though is that I think this movie is fantastic. From my first watch in the cinema until my 2nd watch on a friends small TV this was my favourite move, #1 on the list. I think the large screen and loud audio of the cinema are really important for this film. The cinematography, espeically in space, and the score by Hans Zimmer are fantastic. They give a real sense of scale and how small we are in the universe. The shot where the spaceship is just a tiny spec with Jupiter in the background and the score is swirls up really is breathtaking. This, Mad Max, and The Revenant are three films that are just joyus to look at.</p>
				  <p> When I say that Interstellar is a long film, I mean it. It's the longest on the list and especially the back half has some very some films. It doesn't get repetitive or boring though because it changes scenery and tone quite often. The first third on the farm, the journey to NASA and the stuff on the water planet and in space, the snow planet, and then the mind melting other dimension black hole stuff are all quite different but great in there own respects. The first half of the movie can be seen as build up and it all pays off spectacularly on rhe snow planet and when it gets all trippy. The mix of drama, action and humour helps keep it fresh also. And the tears. I will say a certain scene in the middle had me crying in the cinema.Lastly I'll briefly talk about the performances. Mcconaughey gives the best one of his career, Anne Hathaway is great, Micheal Caine is great, Matt Damon is stranded as he usually is, and I really liked the funny robot guy.</p>
