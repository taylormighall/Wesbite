 <div id="content"> <p> So #10 on the list was Kill Bill, a thrilling action packed joyride with Katanas and snappy dialogue, and #8 is Mad Max: Fury Road, a thrilling action packed (literal) joyride with action and snappy action. That's what this film is. Action. What can I say? I know what I like. The run time is 2 hours, and I'd hazard a guess that 1 hour 30 of it is car chase, and not just any car chase, some of the greatest car chase to grace our screens. The chases were done using practical effects wherever possibly, and this really adds weight to the scenes. You'd think with all this you'd become burnt out about halfway through, and that would be a reasonable thought if not for all the variety. The sandstorm and night scene are great examples of this.</p>
					<p>Another aspect of the film that the sandstorm scene and the night scene highlight well is just how beautiful this film is. The cinematography is really fantastic. The colours are vivid, the oranges of the dessert, the sandstorm, and the blue tone that encompasses everything at night, and especially in 4k everything really pops. This film, along with another 2 later in the list are reasons enough to buy a 4k player and TV in my opinion. If film makers are going to work so hard to make things look so good then we owe it to them to watch in the full glory. Mad Max: Fury Road didn't win 6 technical Oscars for nothing.</p>
					<p> As far as the story goes, it's quite simple, although the first watch can be confusing as things aren't explained obviously. It's very show and not tell. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue, with the titular Max mostly communicating in grunts and pointing. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is really the star of the show, being the driving force in the plot and arguably even more of a badass than Max. This made some misogynist's on the internet very upset. Nicholas Hoult is great as one of Immortan Joe (the bad guy)'s 'War Boys', and in a film without much dialogue, manages to be very quotable with all his "We live, we die, we live again *Sprays chrome*"ing</p>
					<p> In conclusion if you like pretty cinematography, car chases, things exploding, or post apocolyptic Australia, then George Miller has made the film for you and you should immediately buy a 4k TV and watch this in its full glory.</p> </div>
